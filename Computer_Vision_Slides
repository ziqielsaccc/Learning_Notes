#What is Computer Vision?
A simulation of eyes; use to interpret images

#Perception - from light to sight
-What is light?
Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) moving along rays in space
R(λ) is EMR, measured in units of power (watts)

#Plenoptic Function
We can describe all of the light in the scene by specifying the radiation (or “radiance” along all light rays) arriving at every point in space and from every direction

#Camera response function
the process of how camerca captures radiance (L) and process it then spit it out as a final image
while film camera have a long "function", modern day camera simplified a few steps

#sRGB
-industry standard encoding of colors for most cameras, printers, displays, etc.  Most images are encoded as sRGB.
-To convert from sRGB to linear-RGB, a gamma function is applied to each color component x of each pixel (assuming the values are normalized [0,1] rather than [0,255]): f(x) = x^2.2
-You often want to convert to linear before you process an image and then convert back to sRGB f(x) = x^(1/2.2)

#Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
You want as much light as you can get
Some strategies:
-Bigger sensors
-Larger fill factor
-Minimize off time (shutters)
-Long exposures (HDR)

#CMOS and CCD
-CCD sensors, the charge generated by light is moved across the sensor and converted to voltage at the edge
-CMOS sensors use transistors at each pixel to convert the light into voltage locally

#Nyquist
To avoid aliasing
≥ two samples per cycle
-This minimum sampling rate is called the Nyquist rate

#Cross-correlation filtering？？
