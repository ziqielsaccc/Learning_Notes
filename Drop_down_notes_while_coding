#Face detection
-Use grayscale version will be more acurate than original image
eg: faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(convert_gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=3)

#Indentation
-when code shows error, check whether it's indentation error 
like missing a space for "break" 
or what should run in a loop isn't included in the loop (Camera Assistant project)
